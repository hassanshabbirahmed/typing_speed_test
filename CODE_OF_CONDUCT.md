# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful and inclusive
* Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and 
investigated promptly and fairly.
